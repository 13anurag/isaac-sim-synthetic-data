# Isaac Sim Synthetic Data Workflows

This repository contains Python scripts developed using **NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim**
and **Omniverse Replicator** for perception-focused robotics and simulation workflows.

The scripts demonstrate environment setup, camera and lighting randomization,
LiDAR-based 3D data processing, and mesh generation for synthetic data pipelines.

## Contents

- `Camera_omni.replicator.py`  
  Camera pose randomization using Omniverse Replicator, including multi-camera
  setups and automated viewpoint variation for perception tasks.

- `Lightrandomising.replicator.py`  
  Lighting setup and domain randomization using distant and spherical light sources
  with varying intensity, position, and temperature to improve dataset robustness.

- `3dmesh.py`  
  Conversion of LiDAR-based point cloud data into 3D meshes using Python and Open3D,
  applying Poisson surface reconstruction for smooth and usable geometry.

## Use Case

These workflows were created as part of an industry-focused simulation and
perception project involving synthetic data generation, 3D geometry processing,
and computer vision model training.

## Tools & Technologies

- NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim  
- Omniverse Replicator  
- Python  
- Open3D  

## Notes

The code in this repository represents **generalized simulation workflows**.
No proprietary, confidential, or company-owned assets are included.
